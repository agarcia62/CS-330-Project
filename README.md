Project by Alejandro Garcia for CS-330
## What does the program Do
The program is designed to simulate the security installation to installed in many offices and homes. The installation has a keypad and a controller this keypad has 10 keys labeled 0-9.

First may need to download the latest JDK simply search into your browser latest JDK and clikc on the first link. Once the JDK is downloaded then try to run the file again. If it still doesn't work then may need to

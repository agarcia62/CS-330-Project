# CS-330-Project
Project by Alejandro Garcia for CS-330
## What does the program Do
The program is designed to simulate the security installation to installed in many offices and homes. The installation has a keypad and a controller this keypad has 10 keys labeled 0-9. The controller will unlock the lock when it finds the correct un-locking access code in the input string. The security engine will lock the lock when it finds the correct combination. The program will also read from a standard input without echoing the input characters. Any charcters that aren't 0-9 will be discarded discretley. The controller will understand a fixed code. The access code should compromise of the last 5 digits in your student ID. For unlock the last digit will be a 1 for lock the last digit will be a 4.
## How to Build Run the Executable
To build the executable the first step used the Eclipse IDE and clicked file then the export option. Then click on the java folder this should bring up a drop down clock Runnable JAR file. The launch configuration should be the classes needing to be exported click on the correct files. The export destination will be where the runnable JAR will go into your computer. Recommend putting it on the desktop for convience. Do ##NOT change any of the library handling or hit the check box for save as ANT script. This should be the last step to build the executable. To run the executable just double click on the file on the desktop and then program should run. If it doesn't there are two problem that could be happening. First may need to download the latest JDK simply search into your browser latest JDK and clikc on the first link. Once the JDK is downloaded then try to run the file again. If it still doesn't work then may need to open file then clock view search options then this dialog box should open up. Click view and where it says hide extensions for known file types uncheck it and hit apply. Then when clikcing on the fiel click open with and the JDK downloaded should opp up.This should ensure the the executable will run with 0 problems.
## How to Generate Unit Test Coverage
The first step will be creating the JUnit test class this will be found in the package explorer and select new JUnit test case. Click the next button, check the box and click finish. Run the test if a green bar appears then the code passed if a red bar appears then the test failed. You can run coverage analysis against your program by clicking the button to the right of run. Additional tests can be created until 100% of the code is covered. Testing for exceptions can also be done if need be. The test cases need to be done well in order to catch errors just because the code is covered doesnt' mean the test are effective. 
## The platform Its Been Tested On
The platform the program has been testeed on is Eclipse.
